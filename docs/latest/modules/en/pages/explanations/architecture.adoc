:description: An introduction to the architecture of {project-name}.

The system is composed of a UI Extension for user interaction, a ReAct Agent
for intelligent decision-making, and an MCP Server that acts as the
intermediary between the agent and the Rancher API.

== Components

=== https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-ai-agent[ReAct Agent]

The ReAct Agent is the orchestrator of the system’s intelligence. It leverages
a Large Language Model (LLM) as its reasoning engine, while the agent itself
provides the structure, coordination, and secure execution of actions.

* **LLM (Reasoning Engine)**:
** Interprets user inputs expressed in natural language.
** Performs the reasoning: breaks down complex requests into smaller steps.
** Decides what should happen next (keep reasoning vs. take action).
** Synthesizes outputs from tools into clear, human-readable responses.

* **Agent (Orchestrator)**:
** Wraps the LLM with the ReAct (Reason + Act).
** Decides when to let the LLM keep reasoning or when to act on its
   instructions.
** Calls external tools (via the MCP Server) as directed by the LLM.
** Ensures secure interactions by passing the user’s Rancher token to the MCP
   server for authentication and authorization.

=== https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-ai-mcp[MCP Server]

The MCP Server acts as a secure, controlled gateway between the ReAct Agent and the Rancher and Kubernetes APIs. Its functions include:

* **Exposing Tools**: It provides a set of well-defined, safe tools (API
  endpoints) that the ReAct Agent can call. These tools abstract away the
  complexity of direct Rancher/Kubernetes API interactions.
* **Interaction with Rancher**: It translates tool calls from the agent into
  the appropriate API requests to the Rancher management server, retrieving or
  modifying resources as needed.

=== UI Extension

The UI Extension provides the user-facing chat interface within the Rancher
dashboard. It is designed to be a seamless part of the Rancher experience and
is responsible for:

* **User Input**: It captures user queries and sends them to the ReAct Agent.
* **Displaying Responses**: It receives responses from the ReAct Agent and
  presents them in a chat-like format.

== How It Works (Flow)

. **User Request -> Agent -> LLM**: The user submits a natural language query
  through the UI Extension.
. **LLM Reasoning**: The LLM interprets the request, reasons about the problem,
  and proposes a plan.
. **Agent Acting**: If the plan requires external operations, the agent calls
  the appropriate MCP Server tools.
. **LLM Response Formulation**: The LLM takes the tool outputs and crafts a
  coherent, human-readable response.
. **Response -> User**: The answer is returned to the user through the UI
  Extension.

%% Step 1: User sends intent
User -- "1. Query " --> Agent

%% Step 2 & 3: Initial Reasoning Loop
Agent -- "2. Tool Planning Request" --> LLM
LLM -- "3. Action Plan (e.g., list_pods tool)" --> Agent

%% Step 4: Action Execution
Agent -- "4. Execute Tool via MCP" --> MCPServer

%% Step 5 & 6: Cluster Interaction
MCPServer -- "5. Secure Action " --> Kubernetes
Kubernetes -- "6. Raw Results / Status" --> MCPServer

%% Step 7: Raw results back to Agent
MCPServer -- "7. Raw Tool Output" --> Agent

%% Step 8 & 9: Final Interpretation Loop (Crucial step)
Agent -- "8. Interpret Raw Output" --> LLM
LLM -- "9. Formatted Final Answer" --> Agent

%% Step 10: Final Response to User
Agent -- "10. Final Conversational Response" --> User
